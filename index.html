              <h3>I will Do Coding and Change The World</h3>
              <p>
                Code can be incredibly intimidating. Itâ€™s something you can only
                become good at it after hours and hours of practice. Coding is a
                journey that never ends

              <p>
                Most issues in web development can be solved with basic
                engineering concepts. These concepts are often not prioritized
                enough, and ignoring them leads to apps that are difficult to
                debug and build upon.
